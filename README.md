This project aggregates stocks data of different companies from moneycontrol.com and can act as starting point to filter out stocks based on their trends. This will be helpful for rookie investors who cannot figure out which stocks to start from

Run get_stocks_link.py to get the csv which gives the endpoints to hit (ie the pages that will be pinged to get stock data) ..... then run scraper_main.py

This scraping script is not suggested for intraday trading but for something longer say a week,month......

Python version 3.6.9
